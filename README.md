An IoT project where we simulate multiple health sensors and publish them with REST, gRPC and WebSockets using Mosquitto Broker with MQTT protocol to obtain the data and store it in a PostgreSQL database, simulating the publisher-subscriber method of the protocol, all integrated into a Docker Compose.
